# Security Advice Ecosystem 
The motivation for our visualization interface, Security Advice Ecosystem, is to increase user awareness of security advice.
As online users, we all are susceptible to being targeted by security threats. Our goal was to help users understand 
more about safe security measures. We do so by visualizing data on security advice. Our work can be seen here by accessing our project github. Once you download, you will be able to explore different categories of security advice and see how different pieces of advice are ranked in comparison to one another. Hopefully through our visualization you will gain a deeper
insight into key security takeaways that you will be able to adapt in your daily life.
