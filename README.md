# Security Advice Project 
The motivation for our visualization interface, Security Advice Ecosystem, is to increase user awareness of security advice.
As online users, we all are susceptible to being targeted by security threats. Our goal was to help users understand 
more about safe security measures. We do so by visualizing data on security advice. This report will detail the motivation 
of the project, discuss the design goals and implementations of our team, and highlight the evaluation and results of 
our visualization. Furthermore, we will address future works and what can be improved.
